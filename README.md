## Quick Start

Update the following variables in the `Makefile`:

* `APP_NAME` - the name of your Gotenberg's Docker image variant.
* `APP_VERSION`
* `APP_AUTHOR`
* `APP_REPOSITORY`
* `DOCKER_REPOSITORY`

Good 🤓? Now run:

```bash
make it
```

This command builds both your Gotenberg's Docker image variant (`$(DOCKER_REPOSITORY)/gotenberg:7-$(APP_NAME)-$(APP_VERSION)`)
and a tests' Docker image.

## Next steps

1. Update the `go.mod` file with your Go module's name.
2. Update the `build/Dockerfile` with your instructions.
3. Create your module(s) in `pkg/modules`.
4. Import your module(s) in `cmd/app/main.go`.

## FAQ

> How can I run my tests?

```
